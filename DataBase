Game Idea:
The game is a multiplayer Cooperative Operations game when four baby characters
jump from crate to crate in a factory while collecting food (powerups), and
coins you can collect to buy new skins and styles. Their are also other addons,
such as explosives and missiles. We all also stay interactive by making updates
and more options for skins and styles for our addicted fans.

Creators:
Elad Tal, Tal Berry, and Ido Tal.

Company Information:
Our company, Infany, an industry run by kids that make games, is planning to
later on jump right into more complex games and social media apps. Later, we may
jump in to a bit of hardware tech and computer advancement, while taking school
to learn more about computer science. We are planning on becoming company #1!
